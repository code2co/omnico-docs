**Explanation**:
Every ticket can have more than one activity and each activity can have a different status and category. Each activity can be monitored via call time/status/etc. For a ticket to be completely 'solved', each 'activity based action' within a ticket must be in 'done' status. 

7. Tags (Tags are helpful for tracking tickets via predefined keywords)

## Omnico Ticket Journey

Each ticket will follow the the steps below in order to be 'resolved' or 'postponed'.

1.	My Inbox
2.	In Progress
3.	Closed

![agentscreen5](../img/agentscreen5.png)

**My Inbox**

Each ticket is directed to an available agent automatically by the system. When a ticket is directed to an agent, the ticket appears in that agent's 'My Inbox'.  

**In Progress**

Agents will be able to manually carry a ticket from 'My Inbox' to 'In Progress' inbox. The difference between the two is that the tikets under 'In Progress' inbox are the ones that are being answered and that are ongoing.

**Closed**

When an agent is done with a ticket, he/she will manually carry the ticket to the 'Closed' inbox. 

Furthermore, after a ticket goes through the journey above, the ticket has to be tagged either as 'resolved' or 'postponed'. Sisteme düşen mesaj/bildiri, sırasıyla yukarıdaki adımları izledikten sonra, ‘resolved’ veya ‘postponed’ tag’leri ile tag’lenir.  If this ticket is;

**‘Resolved’** - automatically, the ticket is being transferred to Omnico's database.
**‘Postponed'** - the ticket is being transferred to another agent or to the database for future actions.
